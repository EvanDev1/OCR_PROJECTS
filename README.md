# OCR_PROJECTS
A collection of all the small projects I have used OCR in (pretty much all for games)

#### Generic Roleplay Gaem
This was a macro I created for a game I used to play. I used a lot of screen recognition to spot trees to chop down, detect spawn locations, extract the user's money and food levels, etc.  
OCR was mainly used in the world folder and in roles/Lumberjack.py
#### Starscape Image Collector
Used it for building a website about Starscape's market data, I created it to quickly take perfect screenshots of every item in the game.
#### Starscape Recipe Scanner
After taking screenshots of every item (and their recipes) I used this to extract all of the recipe data for crafting each of 1000+ items in the game. Took a lot of effort to get the OCR settings and filters right but eventually got it to work.
#### Starscape Station Scanner
More OCR for Starscape items.
